Recursion:
Many teachers say that recursion is for making input smaller 
this is a wrong mindset wich should be changed
input becomes smaller automatically but our main and promary goal is diffrent i.e. decision + choices

decision + choices : 
first try to look at the problem whether it is a recursion 

Problem statement --> recursive tree design --> code will be cakewalk 




--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
lets take an example : subset problem "abc"

abc subsets: " " ------ 0
             a b c ---- 1
             ab bc ac - 2
             abc ------ 3
now draw a table by yourself first like this  
       a     b    c |
" "    0     0    0 |
a      1     0    0 |
--------------------+ etc.
{  observe this table with choice and decisions 
   remember observation skill should be in you, i cannot help it with that }






       a     b    c               
" "    0     0    0          
a      1     0    0           
b      0     1    0             
c      0     0    1             
ab     1     1    0               
bc     0     1    1               
ac     1     0    1             
abc    1     1    1               
 what happened in a , a is only chosen rest are not, in ab only a and b( these are choices these will create decision)
 also notice we have not taken ba or ca as this is non orderly unqiue subsets then












whenever there is choice and decision, recursion will be there

now making a recursion tree that is input output method :
                  ->op & ip  //   ->op is output is initialized first 
                   /       \
   op1 & smaller ip         op2 & smaller ip 
            /     \
     op1' & ip    op1'' & ip  
     
     
     recursion tree : ab only
     
                   (" ")op ip(ab)   // first decide on 'a' 
                     X /                  \ (a taken)
                      /                    \           
           (" ")op ip(b)                   ("a")op ip(b)   
            X /      \ (b taken)           X /       \ (b taken)
             /        \                     /         \ 
(" ")op ip()        ("b")op ip()    ("a")op ip()      ("ab")op ip()

note :  ** number of branches = number of choices **
input is empty so stop 
you will notice answer is in leaf node
also input becomes smaller and smaller as we go down
     
try with abc now yourself
recursion is used in almost all data structures 

there are three levels of recursion :  according to me 
1. induction base hypothesis (easy)
2. recursion tree (medium)  [ input - output ]
3.choice diagram(very hard) [ dynamic programming ]

the above levels are also the flow of thinking for a question 

*---------------------------*basic recursion or first level of recurion(ibh)*---------------------------------------------------------------------* 

code : print n to 1

// do not learn code just take one look and read explanation
 
 void print(int n)
 {
  if(n==1) // this is base condition
  {
    cout<<n<<" ";
    return ;
  }
  print(n-1);// hypothesis 
  cout<<n<<" "; // induction
 }
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Explanation:
1.  base condition :  last 
       base condition is the smallest input or the largest input that is ".0." this area:  [-input]-------".0."--------[+input]  
       base condition is calculated in last
       .0. is actually the area around 0 
       [-input] and [+input] is also base condtion which are the largest input
  
2. hypothesis :   first 
 first derive hypothesis such as 
 print(n-1) // this will print n-1 numbers where n is any number
 height(tree) //  this will give height of "tree" where tree is any binary tree 
 decide what this function will do( how it will do will be in induction ) and confirm it and stick to that process only
 like print(7) = 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 // print 7 will print 1 2 3 4 5 6 7, this process is hypothesis
 print(6) = 1 2 3 4 5 6
    
              
 



3. induction :   normally not first but exceptions are there 
solve(n) = 1 to n print 
 for solve to do this we do induction 
 because once define it will work the same way  
 we can do it for n to 1 as well but remember solve function just prints a number n we have to do the induction 
 we have to print 1 to 7 
 print(7) ( = 1 2 3 4 5 6 7) then in this : print(6) (as it was "n-1") will print 1 to 6 but then where should be print function put?
 it is according to question,, as it is 1 to 7 so we do before output 
 if it was 7 to 1 we do it after output
 here you have to see on where you have to induce before or after " cout<< "  
 why not recursion tree ? because we need input at every node and not only at leaf node.        [ Next topic level 2 recursion tree in detail ]
